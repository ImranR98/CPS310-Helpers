# CPS310-Helpers
> Programmers are lazy

*~Some Seneca Prof, 2017*

------

Very hastily put together scripts to:
- `ARC-Assembly`: assemble/disassemble code for the ARC instruction set.
- `6809-Assembly`: assemble/disassemble code for the 6809 instruction set.
- `Cache-Mapper`: Get the direct, associative, and set associative cache mapping for a memory location.

Note:
- Meant for use in Ryerson University's CPS 310 course, so only subsets of the full ARC and 6809 ISAs are supported.
- Code is ***freaky*** and probably breaks.
- Use only to double check answers for practice questions â€” plagiarism bad, mmkay?

## Usage

Requires Node.js.

Run `node <script name>.js` to see usage instructions.

Alternatively, run the relevant `-loop.sh` file on UNIX systems for a simpler, continuously looping, interface.
